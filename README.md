This Project focuses on developing a predictive model by integrating two Datasets (Airplane Crashes and Air Traffic Passenger). The aim is to study the trends and patterns related to Air Travel Safety and passenger growth. The integration of multiple datasets helps enhance prediction accuracy and supports better analysis.
